Variable:
	to store the value .
	defined with data type(number,string,date,boolean,decimal,byte).




Object cannot be created for primitive data types:
Primitive Data types In java:
	byte->binary data.(images or any files.)
	short -32768 to 32768

	whole numbers:
	int ==> -2crore to 2 crore
	long

	decimal Numbers:
	float=> upto 7decimal digits
	double=> upto 16 decimal digits

	boolean=>true or false

	char=> 'a'


Object can be created and all object props can be applied
Wrapper classes:
    Byte
    Short
    Integer
    Long
    Float
    Double
    Boolean
    Char

String => java class to store the string datatype.value can be declared with double quotes.


Object Creation in java:
    1.object can be created in java classes.
    2.Muliple objects can be create for a java classes.
    3.Mulitple objects will work independently.
    4.using object can access variable and other props(methods).
    5.object can be created from one class in another.

   //syntax for obj createion in java
classname obj  = new classname();


If condition=>when condition becmes trues.this will execute
If,else condition>when condition is true if will execute..when condition is false else will execute.
If,elseif,else
For loop
While
Switch case


Declare the methods

5+5=>10
10+5=>15


x+y=>res


//method without return
public void name_of_function(){

}

//method with return
public int add(){
	int res = 5+5;
	return res;
}
method overloading->same method with different params.
static method
    variables or methods can be declared as static.

static method or varibles->based on classname
non-static or non-static variables->based on objects.



public static void main

Public->access specifier .can access from anywhere in the application.
Static->no need to create object.using classname can access.
Void-> no return type.
main-> common method name between jdk and java program

oops:
Object oriented programming
inheritance
    inherit the props from one class to another(parent class to child).
    all the variables and methods will be available in the child class.
    java does not allow multiple inheritance.one child can have ony one parent.
    multi level  inheritance can be allowed.

abstract class
    1.A class which is declared with abstract keyword,is considered as abstract class.
    2.for Abstract class object cannot be created.
    3.so abstract classes can be used only in inheritance.
    4.if any methods declare as abstract.tht method has to be override in the child class.


interface
    1.A class which is declared with interface keyword,is considered as interface.
    2.for interface object cannot be created.
    3.so interface can be used only in inheritance.using keyword called implements.
    4.interface should not have any method definition.So only method declaration can be allowd.
    5.So all methods have to be declared in the child class.
    6.

Encapsulation

Constructor:
        method name same as classname
        will call while creating the object.
        no need to call explicitly
        assign the values for the variable while creating object using args.
        load the configuration details while creating the object.
            Ex:Database connection,Logger library.
        Constructor is optional.

 Exception Management:
    1.whenever there is an error.it will not stop the app.it will run the app.
    2.using the syntax;
        try{
            //error code
        }catch(Exception_clasanem obj){
            //print the error if needed.
        }
    3.trying to connect with external files(read or write) or server,database connections,sending response


    throw->to return the error
    throws->to declare the method as it may return the error.
    throwable->Parent class for Exception classes.


Array
	store the multiple values in one variable .
	dynamic  values cannot be added.

Collections
	store the multiple values in one variable .
	dynamic  values can be added.
	Wrapper classes or objects will be use for all the data type.
	cannot use primitive data type.
	datatype should be mention in the diamond operator. <>
	All colletions Generics.

List->arrayList,Vector,LinkedList
Set->HashSet,TreeSet,LinkedHashSet->it should not allow for duplicates.
Stack and queue

Map->HashMap,TreeMap,LinkedHashMap
    1.key and values should be provide.
    2.key should be unique.otherwise value will be override.



Primitive data type:
int,float,char,boolean,long,double.

Wrapper classes:
	Integer
	Float
	Char
	Boolean
	Long
	Double


ArrayList,Vector,LinkedList -> implementation will be same.Internal architecture will be different.

Comparator->will be useful to sort in pojo class



iterator
TreeList->descding iterator



Thread:

1.Using parent class Thread.(using inheritance)
2.using interface Runnable .(using implements)
        java does not support multiple inheritance.so then need to implement the Runnable thread.


Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()->only one thread can execute.
Executors.newFixedThreadPool(count)->based on the count thread can execute.
Executors.newCachedThreadPool()->processor count managed by jdk and it executes.
invokeAny
invokeAll
submit



StringBuffer
StringBuilder



Mysql database
	multiple tables
	each table will have row and col.


CRUD->create,read,update,delete

insert:
Insert into table_name(col_name1,col_name2)values(val1,val2.)
insert into customer(name, email,mobile,address,city,dob)values('testname','testemail@gmail.com','455446','sample address','sample city','1995-05-23')

Read:
	reading the data.
	select * from table_name
	select * from customer;

Update:
Updating the record
	update table_name set col_Name= 'value',col_name2 ='val2' where id= 2;
	update customer set name= 'update name' where id = 1

Delete:
delete from table_name where colname=colval;
delete from customer where customer_no =2;

Keys
	primary key->multiple column can be added together for creating key
	unique key->only one col can be allowed for unique key.

Async();->spring Boot

1.Download the eclipse eeversion
2.Download the tomcat server version.
3.connect the. Eclipse with tomcat server using sever configuration(click window->server in eclipse)



What's servlet.
1.Any java server does not run the java apps directly.
2.So we need a framework in server
	Ex servlet framework:.servlet,spring,struts

Advantages:
1.Servlet is java sever framework. in Order to run the java app in server.
2.servlet can run in tomcat,jboss,websphere( servers)
3.servlet will help us to process the http request and response.


Create a java servlet
    Eclipse->file->New -> Dynamic web project->enter the projcet name.->finish
            Note:check tomcat and version is selected.


Run the apps:
right click the on the project->run as -> run on server.

APP URL:
http://localhost/{appname}
http://localhost/apr_servlet_mor/

Http Methods:
    GET-> to get the data to server.
    POST->to post the data to server
